# **Building a Deep Neural Network from Scratch with Python**
This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch. The steps outlined below guide you through the various stages of this process, from initializing the layers to making predictions with the trained model. If you need a much more explained theoretical explanation, please visit: 

## :sun_with_face: **1. Layer Initialization**
In this step, we define the architecture of our neural network. This includes specifying the number of layers, the number of units (neurons) in each layer, and the activation functions that will be used. Each layer is designed to transform the input data into a more complex representation, ultimately leading to accurate predictions.

## :star2: **2. Parameter Initalization**
Once the network architecture is defined, the next step is to initialize the parameters (weights and biases) for each layer. Proper initialization is crucial as it can significantly impact the convergence of the model during training.

## :arrow_right: **3.- Forward Propagation**
Forward propagation is the process of passing the input data through the network to generate predictions. During this step, each layer’s output is calculated by applying the activation function to the weighted sum of inputs from the previous layer. The final output of the network is the prediction for the given input data.

## :hammer_and_wrench: **4.- Cost Computation**
The cost function measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual target values. The goal of training is to minimize this cost function.

## :arrow_left: **5.- Backward Propagation**
Backward propagation, or backpropagation, is the process of computing the gradients of the cost function with respect to each parameter in the network. This is done by applying the chain rule of calculus to propagate the error backward through the network, from the output layer to the input layer. The gradients are then used to update the parameters.

## :crystal_ball: **6.- Parameter Update (Gradient Descent)**
Once the gradients are computed, the parameters of the network are updated to reduce the cost function. This is done using an optimization algorithm called gradient descent. In each iteration, the parameters are adjusted in the direction opposite to the gradient, with the step size determined by the learning rate.

## :gear: **7.- Model Training**
Training the model involves iteratively performing forward propagation, computing the cost, performing backward propagation, and updating the parameters. This process is repeated for a number of epochs until the model's performance on the training data improves to an acceptable level. During training, it's common to monitor the cost to ensure that the model is learning as expected.

## :dart: **8.- Prediction**
After the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. This step involves performing forward propagation with the trained parameters to generate output predictions. The performance of the model can then be evaluated by comparing the predictions to the actual target values using appropriate metrics.

## :thought_balloon: **9.- Conclusion**
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the step-by-step construction of a neural network from scratch. By understanding and implementing each component—from initializing layers to making predictions—you gain a deeper insight into the mechanics of deep learning. This foundation can be further expanded to develop more complex models and applications in the future.
